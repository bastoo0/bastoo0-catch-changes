You can find the code for the Star Rating calculation in Skills -> Movement.cs

In a nutshell, my changes are the following :
- Giving value to non-hyperdashes & nerfing hyperdashes a little bit
- Giving value to BPM changes
- Increasing the base value for a movement
- Nerfing edge dashes bonus because it isn't so necessary now
